# Crypto-Portfolio

# Problem Statement:
Most crypto portfolios show you how much things are worth at present and the behaviour of the asset as a whole over varying time periods. Unfortunately this isn’t particularly useful for the more casual investors, who may not be diligent in their record keeping and won’t know the price of the asset when they bought in.

# Problem Solution:
Using the API provided by coingecko, provide users with a way to be able to input the date that they bought their assets and find the subsequent price for that day. This will then display to users in a simple form how well their investments are performing. It should also be possible to manually input the price that the user paid as there is great volatility in these assets.
